**Document type:** Single source of truth for Cursor agents and engineers  
**Project:** Multi-Tenant Pharmacy POS & Inventory SaaS  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last updated:** 2026-08-21

> **How to use in a fresh chat:** Attach or `@` this file (`PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md`) plus relevant docs under `docs/`. Follow milestones in order. Do not introduce MongoDB, Mongoose, or any stack outside the Tech Stack below.

## 1. Product Goal

Build a production-grade, **offline-first**, multi-tenant Pharmacy Point of Sale and Inventory SaaS for Bangladesh / emerging markets:

- Sub-50ms local drug search / checkout feel
- Batch-wise expiry tracking with **FEFO** (First Expired, First Out)
- Multi-unit pricing (Box / Strip / Piece)
- Keyboard-first cashier POS
- Cloud PostgreSQL system of record + local SQLite on desktop
- n8n automation (WhatsApp / SMS refill alerts) from Phase 2 onward

### Detailed specs (source docs)

| Handover / stack contract | [docs/Project_Handover.md](docs/Project_Handover.md) |
| Product requirements (PRD) | [docs/Project_Requirement_Documents.md](docs/Project_Requirement_Documents.md) |
| System architecture | [docs/System_Architecture_Technical_Specification.md](docs/System_Architecture_Technical_Specification.md) |
| UI / UX specification | [docs/UX_Specification.md](docs/UX_Specification.md) |

## 2. Canonical Tech Stack (LOCKED)

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Monorepo | Turborepo + npm workspaces |
| Desktop | Tauri (Rust) + React + TypeScript + Vite |
| Web (owner) | React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Shadcn UI |
| Cloud API | Node.js + TypeScript + **Express** |
| ORM / Cloud DB | **Prisma** + **PostgreSQL** |
| Local offline DB | **SQLite** (`pos_local.db`) via Tauri |
| Automation | Self-hosted **n8n** + webhooks |
| Icons / UI | Lucide React, high-density clinical layout |

### Forbidden / removed stacks

Do **not** add or reintroduce:

- MongoDB, Mongoose, or any document-DB ORM
- Competing backend frameworks unless explicitly approved (stick to Express)
- Parallel frontend apps outside `apps/desktop` and `apps/web`

The previous Express + Mongoose scaffold (`r2a-pharma-backend`) was **deleted in Milestone 0**. Useful patterns to re-implement in TypeScript (Milestone 2):

- Module layering: `router → controller → service`
- API prefix `/api/v1`
- Helpers: `AppError`, `catchAsync`, `sendResponse` envelope
- Middleware shape: `protect` + `restrictTo` (extend with `tenantId` from JWT)

  Web[OwnerWeb_apps_web] --> API
```

### Multi-tenancy (locked)

- Shared PostgreSQL with **`tenant_id`** on every domain table
- JWT must embed `tenantId` (and usually `storeId`, `role`, `sub`)
- Every cloud query scoped by `tenant_id` from JWT — never from client body alone
- Postgres RLS policies: Phase 2 defense-in-depth
- Phase 1 MVP: tenant-ready schema, single-store per tenant operations

### Offline sync (locked)

Local queue table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE outbound_sync_queue (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  entity_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  payload TEXT NOT NULL,
  synced INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Conflict rules:

- **Sales / invoices:** append-only, immutable
- **Stock:** delta sync only (`quantity_change`), never absolute overwrite
- Background worker pings cloud every **15s** and flushes FIFO

---

## 5. Non-Negotiable Business Rules

1. **FEFO:** POS recommends the nearest-expiring **non-expired** batch with stock > 0 (search card + Select Batch highlight). Expired lots may still appear in the batch picker but are not sellable. Manual override of FEFO needs permission (later). Cloud `GET …/fefo-batch` / ingest FEFO-fill pick earliest in-stock by expiry (may include expired) — desktop sellable preference is documented in `Completed_API_lists.md` §8.5.
2. **Multi-unit pricing:** Store quantities in lowest unit (e.g. tablets). Convert Box/Strip/Piece at billing. Example: 1 Box = 10 Strips = 100 Tablets.
3. **Keyboard-first POS:** Must work without a mouse.
   - `Ctrl+K` / `/` — focus search  
   - `F2` — new bill  
   - `F4` — generic substitution modal  
   - `F6` — Hold / park active sale  
   - `F7` — Held sales list (toggle)  
   - `F8` — customer / loyalty  
   - `Enter` / `F10` — complete sale + print  
   - `Esc` — clear cart / close modal  
   - `←` `→` (or `↑` `↓` on CTAs) — switch focused modal actions  
   - **`Tab` is never a POS navigator** — ignore Figma Tab hints; use arrows instead
4. **RBAC:**
   - **Cashier:** blocked from margins, base price edits, deleting sales, admin reports
   - **Owner:** full financials, reports, n8n settings
   - Later: Manager, Super Admin (Phase 3)

### UX design tokens (cashier)

- Primary: Teal `#0D9488`
- Accent: Indigo `#4F46E5`
- Background: Slate-50 `#F8FAFC`
- Night: Slate-900 `#0F172A`
- Expiry badges: red ≤30d, yellow ≤90d, green >90d
- Layout: 3-panel POS — search ~40% | cart + checkout ~60% (**locked**; do not follow Figma that shrinks the cart — see `Current_Status.md` §12 Active Cart lock)

---

## 6. Core Domain Model (Prisma — Milestone 1)

Minimum entities:

`Tenant`, `Store`, `User`, `Product`, `ProductUnit`, `Batch`, `Customer`, `Sale`, `SaleItem`, `Payment`

Plus sync ingest identity (`event_id` / idempotency) for offline events.

Roles (pharmacy, not marketplace): `SUPER_ADMIN` | `OWNER` | `MANAGER` | `CASHIER`

- M6 Slice 7 — **BH–BL DONE**: StockAudit / StockAuditLine / StockAuditActivityEvent / FefoViolationRecord schema, shared Zod `audit.ts`, deterministic demo seed, live audit/FEFO APIs, sale ingest FEFO violation hook, Owner web Audit & FEFO dashboard at `/audit`, live Audit Details at `/audit/:auditId` with Review/Approve/Reject modal, and FEFO manual stock correction modal; composed `smoke:m6s7` PASS.
- Desktop manual stock correction uses online signed deltas with reason, optimistic version, idempotent event ID, and authoritative catalog refresh; general batch PATCH never changes quantity
- Postgres RLS policies

---

### Milestone 7 — Scale (PRD Phase 3)

- Multi-branch under one tenant; inter-branch stock transfer
- Fine-grained RBAC (Manager, Super Admin platform)
- AI / analytics summaries via n8n; supplier B2B hooks

## 8. Agent Operating Rules

1. **Milestone gating:** Only implement the milestone the user explicitly authorizes.
2. **Stack fidelity:** Prisma + PostgreSQL + SQLite + Express + Tauri + React only.
3. **Tenant safety:** Never trust client-supplied `tenantId` without JWT verification.
4. **Sync safety:** Never overwrite stock with absolute counts from offline nodes.
5. **POS UX:** Prefer keyboard paths; keep clinical high-density layout.
6. **Scope control:** No drive-by refactors or unrelated docs unless asked.
7. **Secrets:** Never commit `.env`; use `.env.example` only.

---

## 9. Suggested Next Command to the Agent

```text
Follow @PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md @Current_Status.md @ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md
@PRODUCTION_REMAINING_EXECUTION.md @MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md @Completed_API_lists.md
M0–M5 are DONE. M6 production track is active. Waves 0–4 DONE. Next = Authorize Prod Batch S1.
Do not start P* / S* / M7 / bi-di / n8n / RLS / Manager web from the master plan alone.
```

M0–M5 are complete. **M6 Owner Web Slices 1–8 DONE** (BM–BQ; Slice 2 P–AD exit DONE). Production Remaining Work **Waves 0–4 DONE** (2026-09-18). Next = `Authorize Prod Batch S1` (Real Manager PIN). See [`PRODUCTION_REMAINING_EXECUTION.md`](PRODUCTION_REMAINING_EXECUTION.md) + [`PROD_WAVE_5_STUBS_EXECUTION.md`](PROD_WAVE_5_STUBS_EXECUTION.md). **Side enhancement DONE:** Owner Dashboard Intelligence D1–D4 — [`ENHANCE_DASHBOARD_INTELLIGENCE_EXECUTION.md`](ENHANCE_DASHBOARD_INTELLIGENCE_EXECUTION.md) (`smoke:enhance-dash-intel`); does not replace Wave 5; **never invent Baki**. **M7 is PENDING.** Do not start bi-di / n8n / RLS / Manager web / M7 from the master plan alone.
