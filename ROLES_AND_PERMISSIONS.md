## How to use this file

This document is the **system-wide authorization contract**. Use it when building or extending Owner, Manager, and Cashier behavior.

| Layer | Source of truth |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Who may do what** (this file) | `ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md` |
| **What is already built** | [`Current_Status.md`](Current_Status.md) |
| **Live cloud routes / RBAC** | [`Completed_API_lists.md`](Completed_API_lists.md) |
| **Milestones / stack / agent gating** | [`PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md`](PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md) |

**Precedence**

1. Do **not** start M5 / Owner web / Manager back-office / schema changes from this file alone. The user must authorize the milestone.
2. For **already-shipped** cashier POS and cloud API behavior, `Current_Status.md` + `Completed_API_lists.md` describe what runs today. This file must not be used to regress those locks.
3. When Owner/Manager work is authorized, **implement toward this matrix** — unless the user re-locks a cell.
4. Older specs under `docs/` (PRD, handover) that disagree with this file are **superseded** here for roles, payments, and customer-create.

**Payments (locked for the whole product):** `CASH` \| `CARD` \| `MFS` only. Every sale is **fully settled** at complete. There is no on-account tender, no customer due ledger, and no credit-limit workflow. Do not add one in any milestone.

## 1. Hierarchy and personas

|  [ CASHIER / PHARMACIST] -> Counter staff (checkout execution only)     |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Prisma / JWT roles (locked): `SUPER_ADMIN` \| `OWNER` \| `MANAGER` \| `CASHIER`.

### Pharmacy Owner

* **Access:** Root authority for one tenant.
* **Live UI:** Owner web (`apps/web`) — **M6 Slice 1 A–O DONE** + **Slice 2 P–AB DONE** + **Slice 3 AE–AM DONE** + **Slice 4 Staff AN–AV DONE** + **Slice 5 Shift Details and variance review through BB DONE** + Slice 6 Sales Report DONE + Slice 7 Audit & FEFO dashboard DONE. Manager/Cashier rejected on web. Audit Detail remains gated for BK.
* **Until web exists:** Owner may log into desktop POS (`apps/desktop`) with the same JWT role. Desktop remains a **cashier workstation**, not the executive suite.
* **Scope:** Financials and margins, staff, catalog/pricing, settings, audit, n8n (M6), multi-branch (M7).

### Store Manager

* **Access:** Operational admin at store level.
* **Target UI:** Receiving/stock = **desktop Settings** (M5). Owner/Manager web = **M6**.
* **Until then:** Manager may log into desktop POS like a cashier, plus live cloud rights already granted (catalog/batch create, staff create). See §3.
* **Scope:** GRN / batch receiving, stock adjust, FEFO override authorization, shift review, customer **search** (not create). Supervises cashiers.

### Cashier / Pharmacist

* **Access:** Strict transactional scope on Tauri desktop POS (`apps/desktop`).
* **Scope:** Search, FEFO checkout, cart, settled payments, loyalty lookup/redeem (session today), receipts, hold, shift open/close (local today).
* **Blocked:** Creating customers, seeing `costPerBase` / margins, mutating sell/cost prices, deleting sales, admin/financial reports.

### Super Admin

* **Access:** Platform SaaS (tenants, billing, health) — **M7**. Role exists on User / JWT only. **No** console or routes today. Super Admin does **not** operate a pharmacy POS.

| Audit & FEFO | **APIs live (M6 BI)** and Owner web Audit & FEFO dashboard live at `/audit` (M6 BJ). StockAudit and FEFO violation records exist; Owner audit dashboard/list/detail/review/correct APIs live; Owner/Manager audit start/lines/submit APIs live; sale ingest records FEFO override violations. Audit Detail UI remains gated. | Owner web Audit detail/review = **BK** |

## 4. Live cloud RBAC (do not regress)

Matches `Completed_API_lists.md`. JWT claims: `{ sub, role, tenantId, storeId }`. `tenantId` from JWT only.

| Route | Roles |
|-------|--------|
| `POST /api/v1/users` | `OWNER`, `MANAGER` — body role `CASHIER` \| `MANAGER` only |
| `POST /api/v1/products`, `PATCH /products/:id` | `OWNER`, `MANAGER` |
| `POST /api/v1/batches` | `OWNER`, `MANAGER` |

| `POST /api/v1/batches/:id/corrections` | `OWNER`, `MANAGER` — reason + expected version + idempotency key |
| `POST /api/v1/batches/:id/adjustments` | `OWNER`, `MANAGER` — signed delta + reason + expected version; cashier `403` |
| `POST /api/v1/batches/:id/void`, `/retire` | **`OWNER` only** |
| `POST /api/v1/customers` | `OWNER` (Active, `OWNER_CREATED`/`POS_REGISTRATION`) + `MANAGER`/`CASHIER` (Pending `POS_REGISTRATION`, names+phone only) — **M6 AF** live |
| `GET /api/v1/customers` | Any authenticated |
| `PATCH /api/v1/customers/:id` | `OWNER`, `MANAGER` — cashier `403` (search-only at POS) |
| `POST /api/v1/sales/ingest`, `POST /api/v1/sync/ingest` | Any authenticated; sales **append-only** (no update/delete routes) |
| `GET /api/v1/sales`, `GET /api/v1/sales/:id` | Any authenticated. **Redact** `costPerBaseAtSale` / COGS / netProfit / margins unless `OWNER` (`:id` = `Sale.id`). `customerId` additive filter (M6 AF) |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/dashboard`, `/owner/inventory-summary`, `/owner/expiry` | **`OWNER` only** (`403` for Manager and Cashier) |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/reports/sales` | **`OWNER` only** (`403` for Manager and Cashier) — Sales Report aggregate API (M6 BE); Owner web UI live at `/reports/sales` (M6 BF) |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/audit/dashboard`, `GET /owner/audits`, `GET /owner/audits/:id` | **`OWNER` only** (`403` for Manager and Cashier) — audit dashboard/list/detail APIs (M6 BI) |
| `POST /api/v1/owner/audits/:id/review`, `POST /owner/fefo-violations/:id/correct` | **`OWNER` only** — review submitted/variance audits and mark OPEN FEFO violations corrected (M6 BI) |
| `POST /api/v1/audits/start`, `POST /audits/:id/lines`, `POST /audits/:id/submit` | `OWNER`, `MANAGER` — API-only stock count lifecycle; Cashier 403; desktop count UI deferred (M6 BI) |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/inventory` | **`OWNER` only** (`403` for Manager and Cashier) |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/products/:id` | **`OWNER` only** — full product detail + batches + FEFO rank + InventoryEvent (M6K) |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/batches/:id` | **`OWNER` only** — management context + revisions/adjustments |

> **M6L:** Owner web `POST /products` (via `apps/web` Add Product form) creates catalog-only rows — zero initial stock. Extended fields: `manufacturer`, `strength`, `form`, `category`, `requiresPrescription`, `coldChain`, `storageNotes`, `reorderLevel`. Cashier `403`.

---

## 5. Customer authority (locked)

**Live today (Slice 3 AF DONE):** `POST /customers` is role-aware — Owner creates Active immediately; Cashier/Manager POS creates Pending (names + phone only). `GET /customers` returns Active-only. `GET /customers/phone-check` and `/owner/customers*` (list/detail/approve/reject) are live OWNER-only routes.

**Slice 3 lock (implement in AE–AL; do not invent ahead of the authorized batch):**

* **Owner create** (Admin Portal Add Customer, or Owner on POS) → **Active immediately**. Web source = `OWNER_CREATED`. POS source = `POS_REGISTRATION`.
* **Cashier / Manager POS create** → **Pending Approval**. Name + phone only. Not searchable at F8 and not attachable to a sale until the Owner approves.
* **Owner approve** on Registration Review → Active (Owner may add email / DOB / gender / address). **Reject** → hidden; phone may be reused.
* **Fields:** `name`, **required `phone`**, optional `email`, `dateOfBirth`, `gender`, `address`. Do **not** surface `creditBalance`.
* **Cashier at checkout:** search **Active** customers only (`GET /customers`); apply loyalty if eligible; if not found → **Walk-in** or POS Create (pending).
* **`loyaltyPoints`:** display/redeem at POS (session settlement). Authoritative persist = **M6 Batch D** ingest snapshots when `loyaltyUsed`/`loyaltyEarned` are sent with an **Active** `customerId`.
* **Edit Customer** stays parked in Slice 3. `PATCH /customers/:id` remains Owner/Manager API-only.
* **`creditBalance`:** unused schema leftover. Do **not** expose in UI, mutate via POS, or build features on it.

---

## 6. Owner — executive suite

Slice 1 Owner screens are live. Remaining items below require their matching later M6/M7 authorization and must not be invented on cashier POS.

* Revenue, COGS, gross profit, net margin (Owner only — never Cashier, never Manager).
* Staff: create / deactivate Manager and Cashier; audit who changed prices or stock.
* Catalog and pricing; pharmacy / receipt header (desktop Settings already: Owner/Manager edit, Cashier view-only).
* Supplier payables and PO dispatch (**M6**, not a customer-due ledger).
* n8n: refill WhatsApp/SMS, PO rules (**M6**).
* Multi-branch analytics and transfer approval (**M7**).
* Optional later: cashier max-discount cap with Manager PIN — **authorize first**.

---

## 7. Manager — target operations suite

Build with **M5** stock/GRN and **M6** web as authorized.

* **GRN / receiving:** incoming lots — batch number, `expiryDate`, qty in PIECE, `costPerBase`, `sellPerBase`.
* **Stock adjust:** damage / write-off within threshold; above threshold → Owner.
* **Supplier return bucket (~90 days to expiry)** — **M6**.
* **Draft POs** from low-stock — **M6**.
* **FEFO override:** Manager/Owner PIN (real verify when authorized).
* **Shift review:** after cloud shift exists, see cashier close variance (see §10).
* **Customers:** search and (M6) edit. **Cannot create.**

---

## 8. Guardrails

### Price protection

Cashiers must not change `costPerBase` or `sellPerBase`. Live API already `403`s those fields for `CASHIER`. Owner and Manager may set catalog/batch prices via API today. Do not add a second “Manager needs Owner approval” price workflow unless the user asks.

### Stock vs shelf

POS recommends FEFO batch + expiry; cashiers match packs on the shelf. Cycle-count / discrepancy alerts to Owner are **M6+** — do not invent until authorized.

### Sales immutability

Sales are **append-only**. There is no void, edit, or delete invoice API. Do not add one for Owner or Manager unless the user re-authorizes.

---

## 9. FEFO override

### 9.1 Today (do not treat as production auth)

Desktop stub: any **4-digit** PIN + local “Authorized By” list. Audit is `notes` / cart `fefoOverride` only. **Do not ship this stub to pilot.** See `apps/desktop/src/lib/fefoOverrideAuth.ts`.

### 9.2 Target (when real FEFO auth is authorized)

Default pick = earliest **sellable** lot (`expiryDate` ≥ today, qty > 0). Choosing a later-expiring lot opens Manager/Owner PIN.

```text
[ Cashier selects non-FEFO batch ]
                 │
                 ▼
        FEFO override modal
        Owner/Manager 4-digit PIN
                 │
      ┌──────────┴──────────┐
      ▼                     ▼
[ Valid PIN ]         [ Invalid PIN ]
Batch updated +       Selection rejected
audit on sale line
```

**Storage (additive — do not replace `User`):**

* Never store a PIN in plain text.
* When authorized, add optional `pinHash` + `pinUpdatedAt` on the existing Prisma `User` (`cuid()`, camelCase `tenantId`, bcrypt/Argon2id).
* Desktop may cache **hashes only** in the local catalog for offline verify.
* Prefer an override **flag + authorizer id on the sale line / ingest payload** (already listed as a planned API). Do not add a separate `fefo_override_logs` table unless authorized.

Field names stay Prisma-locked: `expiryDate`, not `expirationDate` / `expiration_date`.

---

## 10. Shift close

**Today:** local `shiftStore` (tenant+store). Soft gate: New Sale requires an open shift. No cash count. No cloud shift API.

**Target (when cloud shift is authorized):**

1. Cashier Close Shift → enter **physical cash** in drawer.
2. Hide system expected total (opening float + cash sales) until after submit.
3. Log variance for Owner/Manager review.

Latin digits only in UI (e.g. ৳150).

---

## 11. Owner / Manager web blueprint (M6 — not current UI)

Brand: **PharmaSync**. Do not use other product names. No due/credit metric card.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

POS chrome stays the locked 3-panel cashier layout (search ~40% / cart ~60%). This blueprint is **web only**.

---

## 12. Forbidden (whole product, every milestone)

Do **not** implement:

* On-account sales, customer due, credit limits, or any unpaid remainder parked on a customer
* A fourth payment method beyond `CASH` \| `CARD` \| `MFS`
* Create Customer on desktop POS **except** Slice 3 Batch AL (name + phone; Cashier/Manager pending; Owner Active)
* Manager or Cashier `POST /customers` **as Active** — pending only until Owner approves
* Attaching a pending/rejected customer to a sale (ingest must require Active)
* Sale void / update / delete
* Super Admin POS or tenant-data console before M7
* Replacing Prisma `User` / snake_case schemas / `uuid()` ids (use `cuid()` + camelCase)
* Surfacing or mutating `Customer.creditBalance`
* Hard-coded UI strings on new Owner/Manager screens (use `t("...")` + `en.ts` / `bn-BD.ts`)
* Tab as a POS navigator (arrows + Enter + Esc)
