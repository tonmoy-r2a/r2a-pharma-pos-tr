# Milestone 6 — Slice 6+ (Batch Execution Plan)

**Document type:** Fresh-chat execution guide for M6 Slices **6–8** (continues after Slice 5)  
**Parent file (Slices 1–5):** [`MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md`](MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md) — **do not read the whole file** for Slice 6+ work; use **this file** instead.  
**Source of truth:** [`PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md`](PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md)  
**Live progress context:** [`Current_Status.md`](Current_Status.md)  
**API catalog:** [`Completed_API_lists.md`](Completed_API_lists.md)  
**RBAC contract:** [`ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`](ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md)  
**Authorized plan:** [`.cursor/plans/m6_slice_6_execution.plan.md`](.cursor/plans/m6_slice_6_execution.plan.md) (2026-08-22)

**Status of Slices 6–8:** **DONE** (product scope for Slices 6–8) — Slice 6 **BE–BG DONE**; Slice 7 **BH–BL DONE**; Slice 8 **BM–BQ DONE** 2026-09-18. **Next = `Authorize M6 Batch AC`** (Prod Wave 2 / [`MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md`](MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md)).  
**Production track:** [`PRODUCTION_REMAINING_EXECUTION.md`](PRODUCTION_REMAINING_EXECUTION.md) — Wave 0 **DONE**; Wave 1 **BN–BQ DONE**. UI invent allowed via `invent to match theme` after the mandatory ask-stop (see master).  
**Prerequisite:** Milestone 0–**5** DONE; M6 Slice 1 **A–O DONE**; W1–W6 **DONE**; Slice 2 **P–AB DONE** (AC–AD via Prod Wave 2); Slice 3 **AE–AM DONE**; Slice 4 **AN–AV DONE**; Slice 5 **AW–BD DONE**; Slice 6 **BE–BG DONE**; Slice 7 **BH–BL DONE**; Slice 8 **BM–BQ DONE**.  
**Do not start:** AC until user says `Authorize M6 Batch AC`. Out of scope unless re-authorized: Manager web, n8n, RLS, bi-di, M7.

## How to use this file

1. Open a **fresh Cursor chat** for each batch.
2. Attach / `@` these files:
   - `PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md`
   - `Current_Status.md`
   - `ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`
   - **`M6_SLICE_6_EXECUTION.md`** (this file — **not** the full `MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md`)
   - `Completed_API_lists.md`
3. Paste **only** that batch’s **Agent prompt** (or say `Authorize M6 Batch X`).
4. **UI batches:** agent **must ask for the screen first** (see Re-share protocol below). **Do not implement UI until you reply.**
5. Agent implements **only** that batch after the screen/decision is settled.
6. When the batch is done, the agent pastes the **short report**. You review.
7. Mark the batch checkbox when its exit check passes.
8. Proceed to the next batch only after the previous one is green.

> **Hard rules:**
> - Implement **one batch per chat**. Do not collapse Slice 6 BE–BG, Slice 7 BH–BL, or Slice 8 BM–BQ into a single run.
> - **Build only the active slice/batch.** Batch BE is done; BF+ still require explicit one-batch authorization.
> - **Re-share gate (mandatory for UI batches):** the agent **never** assumes “prior upload” or inventing. It **asks you first** and **stops**. Only after you say **use prior upload**, **invent to match theme**, or **re-share a new screenshot** may it build UI.
> - **Scroll doubles:** mocks delivered as two screenshots of the **same page** (top + scrolled bottom) = **one route**, full vertical scroll. Do not split into sub-routes.
> - **Mock inconsistency:** chrome is locked (Dashboard chrome from Slice 1 Batch B). Per-screen mocks drive *content only*. Do not restyle chrome to match dark/purple sidebars in later mocks.
> - `apps/web` is **OWNER only**. Manager and Cashier must not use it.
> - No invented KPI/table rows. Live Prisma via Express.
> - Payments stay **`CASH` \| `CARD` \| `MFS` only**. No Baki / on-account.
> - Localization: `t("...")` + `apps/web` `en.ts` + `bn-BD.ts`. Do not translate domain/runtime data (names, SKUs, batch numbers, emails, phones, receipt IDs). Latin digits only.

## Walkthrough + short-report protocol (mandatory)

| Kind | Who | What |
|------|-----|------|
| **Agent smoke** | Agent | Batch `smoke:m6*` when the batch lists one |
| **User review** | **You** | Short **YOU DO** list. If **None**, confirm smoke only |

**Agent must, at the end of every batch chat:**

```text
## M6 Batch <ID> report
Done: <1–3 bullets>
Smoke: PASS | FAIL | n/a — <script name>
YOU DO: <numbered, or none>
Next: Authorize M6 Batch <next>
```

Do **not** start the next batch in the same chat.

---

## Screen re-share protocol (UI batches) — STRICT

**Problem this fixes:** agents must **not** silently use an old upload or guess layout when UI does not match the mock.

### Rule

For **every UI batch** (BF, BJ, BK, BN, BO, BP) and any batch whose table says **Re-share screen**:

1. Agent’s **first message** after `Authorize M6 Batch X` is **only** the ask below.
2. Agent **stops** — no schema reads for UI layout, no component code, no “I’ll use the prior upload”.
3. You reply with **one** of:
   - Re-share the screenshot(s) for that screen (include **scroll bottom** if the mock was split).
   - **`use prior upload`** — agent may use screenshots already shared in this project/chat history.
   - **`invent to match theme`** — agent may invent layout matching Admin Portal / Dashboard chrome family (document what was invented).
4. Only **after** your reply does the agent implement that batch.

### Ask template (agent must paste verbatim, fill `<ID>` and `<Screen name>`)

```text
⏸ Batch <ID> needs the visual for: "<Screen name>".
Please re-share that screenshot (include scroll-bottom sections if the mock was split),
or reply exactly: use prior upload | invent to match theme.
Stopping until you reply — no UI code until then.
```

### If UI still does not match after build

You reply **FAIL — UI mismatch** with what is wrong. Agent fixes in a **new chat** for the same batch (or a small fix batch if you authorize).

### Slice 6–8 screen names (exact labels)

| # | Screen name | Batch | Re-share? |
|---|-------------|-------|-----------|
| 33 | **Sales Report** (top + scroll: Recent Sales Transactions) | BF | **Yes — ask first** |
| 34 | **Audit & FEFO** (dashboard) | BJ | **Yes — ask first** |
| 35 | **Audit Detail** | BK | **Yes — ask first** |
| — | **Review Audit** (modal) | BK | **Not shared — ask; invent only if you say invent** |
| 36 | **Settings** (hub) | BN | **Yes — ask first** |
| 37 | **Business Profile** | BN | **Yes — ask first** |
| 38 | **Account Profile** | BO | **Yes — ask first** |
| 39 | **Help & Support** | BP | **Yes — ask first** |

Chrome baseline: **Dashboard** (Slice 1). Ignore dark/purple sidebars in new mocks.

---

## Scroll-page rule (critical)

| Screen | Route | Rule |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Sales Report** | `/reports/sales` | One page: KPIs → chart/payment/widgets → Top Selling Medicines → **Recent Sales Transactions** (scroll). Not two routes. |
| **Audit & FEFO** | `/audit` | One page: KPIs → Expiry + FEFO cards → Recent Stock Audits + Activity Log. |
| **Audit Detail** | `/audit/:auditId` | One page: summary cards → line table → FEFO card → timeline + notes. |

QA: bottom sections reachable by scroll on a short viewport.

---

## Incremental slice protocol

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Parent | Slices 1–5 live in [`MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md`](MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md). **This file** = Slices 6–8 only. |
| Active scope | **Slice 6 done.** Continue one batch at a time: BH → … → BQ. |
| Slice 6 complete | Batch BG exit + walkthrough PASS |
| Slice 7 complete | Batch BL exit + walkthrough PASS |
| Slice 8 complete | Batch BQ exit + walkthrough PASS |
| M6 milestone complete | **Not** Slice 8 — AC–AD, bi-di, n8n, RLS, Manager web still open |
| Parallel | Deferred Slice 2 **AC–AD** may be authorized separately — do not mix with BE+ in one chat |
| Invent authorization | **Review Audit modal** (BK) — invent **only** after you say `invent to match theme` |
| Desktop stock count | Manager start/submit count APIs in BI; **desktop UI** = later backlog (seed + Owner review for walkthrough) |

---

## Sidebar IA (after Slice 8 BQ)
