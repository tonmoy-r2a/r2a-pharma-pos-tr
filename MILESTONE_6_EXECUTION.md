## How to use this file

1. Open a **fresh Cursor chat** for each batch.
2. Attach / `@` these files:
   - `PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md`
   - `Current_Status.md`
   - `ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`
   - **Slices 1–5:** `MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md` (this file)
   - **Slices 6+:** [`M6_SLICE_6_EXECUTION.md`](M6_SLICE_6_EXECUTION.md) **instead of reading this entire file**
   - `Completed_API_lists.md`
3. Paste **only** that batch’s **Agent prompt** (or say `Authorize M6 Batch X`).
4. If the batch says **Re-share screen**, the agent **asks for that named screenshot**, then **stops** until you provide it (or say **use prior upload** / **invent to match theme**).
5. Agent implements **only** that batch after the screen/decision is settled.
6. When the batch is done, the agent pastes the **short report** (template below). You review.
7. Mark the batch checkbox when its exit check passes.
8. Proceed to the next batch only after the previous one is green.

> **Hard rules:**
> - Implement **one batch per chat**. Do not collapse Slice 1 A–O, Slice 2 P–AB, Slice 3 AE–AM, Slice 4 AN–AV, or Slice 5 AW–BD into a single run.
> - **Build only the active slice.** Slice 1 is **DONE**. Slice 2 **P–AB DONE** (AC–AD **deferred**). Slice 3 **AE–AM DONE**. Slice 4 **AN–AV DONE**. Active scope is **Slice 5** (BD exit). **AW–BC DONE**; next batch is **BD**. Later screens → Slice 6+.
> - **Mock inconsistency:** chrome is locked (same as M3). Per-screen mocks drive *content only*. The agent **handles** layout/theme/nav mismatches — do not restyle chrome to match a later/earlier mock.
> - **Missing next screen:** if a control implies a flow we do not have a screenshot for, the agent **asks and guides** — do not invent that screen, and do not silently skip without asking. Slice 5 invents only **desktop open/close float+count** (extend Shift panel family); shift/report screens use **prior upload**.
> - `apps/web` is **OWNER only**. Manager and Cashier must not use it.
> - No invented KPI/table rows. Live Prisma via Express. Shared APIs with POS (no second sales store).
> - Payments stay **`CASH` \| `CARD` \| `MFS` only**. No Baki / on-account. No sale void.
> - Localization: Owner web strings use `t("...")` + `apps/web` `en.ts` + `bn-BD.ts`. Do not translate medicine names, customer/staff names, emails, usernames, batch numbers, TXN ids, phones, barcodes, SKUs. Latin digits only. UI locale does **not** change receipt body.
> - Tab is never a POS navigator (desktop unchanged). Owner web may use normal web focus.

## Walkthrough + short-report protocol (mandatory)

| Kind | Who | What |
|------|-----|------|
| **Agent smoke** | Agent | Batch `smoke:m6*` when the batch lists one |
| **User review** | **You** | Short **YOU DO** list. If **None**, confirm smoke only |

**Agent must, at the end of every batch chat:**

1. Paste this **short report** (keep it short):

```text
## M6 Batch <ID> report
Done: <1–3 bullets>
Smoke: PASS | FAIL | n/a — <script name>
YOU DO: <numbered, or none>
Next: Authorize M6 Batch <next>
```

2. Do **not** start the next batch in the same chat.

**You should, after every batch:**

1. Run **YOU DO** (if any).
2. Reply **PASS** or **FAIL**.
3. Open a **new chat** for the next batch only after PASS (or after FAIL is fixed).

---

## Screen re-share protocol (UI batches)

If the batch table says **Re-share screen: \<Name\>**, the agent’s **first** message after authorize is:

```text
⏸ Batch X needs the visual for: "<Screen name>".
Please re-share that screenshot (or say "use prior upload" / "invent to match theme").
Stopping until you reply.
```

Then stop. After you share (or say use prior), implement that batch only.

**Slice 1 screen names (exact labels):**

| # | Screen name | Batch |
|---|-------------|-------|
| — | Owner Login | A — **invent** (not shared; match Admin Portal family) |
| 1 | **Dashboard** | G |
| 2 | **Sales Overview & Transactions** | H |
| 3 | **Transaction Details** | I |
| 4 | **Inventory** | J |
| 5 | **Product Details** | K |
| 6 | **Add Product** | L |
| 7 | **Receive Stock** | M |
| 8 | **Expiry Management** | N |

**Slice 2 screen names (exact labels):**

| # | Screen name | Batch |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 9 | **Purchasing** | T |
| 10 | **Create Purchase Order** | U |
| 11 | **Purchase Order Details** | V |
| 12 | **Receive Stock** (against PO — not Inventory Add Lot) | W |
| 13 | **Suppliers** | X |
| 14 | **Add Supplier** | Y |
| 15 | **Supplier Details** | Z |
| 16 | **Expiry Returns** | AA |
| 17 | **Create Return Manifest** | AB — **no screenshot yet; stop and ask** |
| 18 | **Return Manifest Details** | AC — **DONE** |
| — | **Record Supplier Return Dispatch** | AC modal — **DONE** |
| — | **Record Supplier Decision** | AC modal — **DONE** |
| — | **Complete Return** | AC modal — **DONE** |

**Slice 3 screen names (exact labels):**

| # | Screen name | Batch |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 19 | **Customers** | AH |
| 20 | **Add Customer** | AI |
| — | **Create Customer** (confirm modal) | AI |
| 21 | **Customer Details** | AJ |
| 22 | **Customer Registration Review** | AK |
| — | **Approve Customer** | AK modal — shared |
| — | **Reject Registration** | AK modal — invent from spec below |
| — | **POS Create Customer** | AL — **invent** (name + phone; match Select Customer family) |

**Slice 4 screen names (exact labels):**

| # | Screen name | Batch |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 23 | **Staff** | AQ |
| 24 | **Add Staff** | AR |
| 25 | **Staff Details** (Active) | AS |
| 26 | **Staff Details** (Inactive) | AS |
| 27 | **Edit Staff** | AT |
| — | **Deactivate Staff** | AU modal — shared |
| — | **Reactivate Staff** | AU modal — shared |

**Slice 5 screen names (exact labels):**

| # | Screen name | Batch |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 28 | **Shift Management** | AZ |
| 29 | **Shift Details** (Open) | BA |
| 30 | **Shift Details** (Closed, balanced) | BA |
| — | **Review Cash Variance** | BB modal — shared |
| 31 | **Shift Details** (resolved variance) | BB |
| 32 | **Reports Dashboard** | BC |

Chrome baseline: **Dashboard** (first shared screen). Later mocks that use a dark sidebar → **ignore**; keep the chrome lock below.

Same family of rules as [`MILESTONE_3_EXECUTION.md`](MILESTONE_3_EXECUTION.md) (chrome lock + do not invent unshared flows). Owner-web extras: **handle inconsistent mocks**; **ask + guide** when the next relevant screen is missing.

---

## Mock inconsistency + missing-flow protocol (mandatory)

Owner screens will disagree with each other (sidebar light vs dark, brand string, extra header icons, different card order, purple vs teal). The agent **must handle this** — do not bounce every mismatch back to the user, and do not “fix” chrome to match the latest PNG.

### A. Inconsistent mocks — agent handles (do not ask)

Follow the **Chrome consistency lock**. Copy **only the content region** from the named screen.

| Conflict | What the agent does |
|----------|---------------------|
| Dark vs light sidebar, different brand, extra header widgets | **Ignore.** Keep Dashboard chrome (Batch B) |
| Branch switcher looks enabled | Show store **name**; keep **disabled** (M7) |
| Decorative sample numbers (৳124,850, TXN-260814-1045) | Live API data only |
| Parked controls (bell, Prepare Return) | This file’s parked table — disable/omit; do not invent backends. W2 made Edit Product live; Batch N made CSV Export and persisted batch supplier/return metadata live. |
| Copy that implies returns / Baki / due | Follow product locks, not the mock caption |

On conflict: **this file + chrome lock > individual screenshot > Figma.**

### B. Missing next screen / broken flow — agent asks and guides (must stop)

If a **live** control on the current Slice 1 screen needs a **destination we do not have** (no screenshot, not in this slice, not parked as disabled), the agent **does not invent** that screen and **does not ship a dead click** without asking.

**Ask (then stop):**

```text
⏸ Batch X: "<Current screen>" has "<control>" but I do not have the next screen.

That flow looks like: <one sentence>.
I need you to either:
  1. Share that next screenshot, or
  2. Say "park it" (disable / later slice), or
  3. Say "invent" (match Admin Portal chrome; I will describe what I will build).

Stopping until you reply.
```

**Guide** in the same message: name the likely next screen, which slice/backlog bucket it belongs in, and the default if they say nothing (default = **park / disable**, never invent).

Examples that **must** trigger this ask (unless already parked in this file):

- Create Customer, Staff detail, PO / Supplier pages, Settings, Help, Owner Profile
- Any new modal/page implied by a primary CTA that is **not** listed in Slice 1 routes

Examples that **must not** trigger an ask (already locked):

- Disabled later-nav items (Customers/Staff/…), header bell/search, branch switch. Slice 2 Inventory **Prepare Supplier Return** is wired in Batch AA (do not treat as parked after AA).

### C. When the agent may proceed without asking

- Scaffolding / APIs / ingest locked by this file
- Invent-authorized Owner Login (Batch A)
- Chrome mismatches (section A)
- Parked controls (section A + parked table)

---

## Standing setup

### Terminals

**Terminal 1 — cloud API**

```bash
npm run dev -w @r2a/server
```

Wait until listening (`http://127.0.0.1:8787`). Repo-root `.env`: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`. `CORS_ORIGIN` already includes `http://localhost:5173` (web) and `http://localhost:1420` (desktop). Also allow `http://127.0.0.1:5173` if missing.

**Terminal 2 — Owner web (from Batch A onward)**

```bash
npm run dev -w @r2a/web
```

Open **http://localhost:5173/**  
`apps/web/.env`: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787`

**Terminal 3 — desktop** (Batch D POS ingest + any dual-path check)

```bash
npm run dev -w @r2a/desktop
```

Open **http://localhost:1420/**

### Seed login

| Role | Email | Password | `apps/web` |
|------|-------|----------|------------|
| Owner | `owner@demo.local` | `ChangeMe123!` | **Allowed** |
| Manager | `manager@demo.local` | `ChangeMe123!` | **Reject** |
| Cashier | `cashier@demo.local` | `ChangeMe123!` | **Reject** |

Demo drug: **Napa** / sku `NAPA-500`.

## Acknowledgement — Plan & Status Audit (read-only)

This section records that `PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md`, `Current_Status.md`, `Completed_API_lists.md`, `ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`, `MILESTONE_3_EXECUTION.md`, `MILESTONE_5_EXECUTION.md`, and the authorized M6 Slice 1 plan were read before writing this file. **No application code is written by this document alone.**

### Where we are

| Item | State |
|------|--------|
| M0–M5 | **DONE** |
| Cloud API | Real — prior Slice 1 routes plus Owner batch detail; audited/versioned corrections; signed adjustments; Owner-only void/retire. General batch PATCH is metadata/price only. |
| `@r2a/desktop` | POS shell + one-way sync + Receive stock; W6 signed/versioned/reasoned online stock adjustment with catalog refresh |
| `@r2a/web` | **Batch M + W2/W5 DONE** — live Dashboard, Sales, Inventory, Product Add/Edit/Receive, and Batch Management |
| Schema | Batch C plus W1 lifecycle/version/revision, sale display snapshots, and InventoryEvent idempotency/result metadata |
| Ingest | **Batch D DONE** — `receiptNo`, cost snapshot, loyalty, FEFO flags, `InventoryEvent` SALE/RECEIVE/ADJUST |
| Loyalty | Session calc on POS; **Batch D** snapshots `loyaltyUsed`/`loyaltyEarned` on ingest when present |
| FEFO override | POS PIN stub unchanged; ingest persists `fefoOverride` + `fefoAuthorizedByName` (notes still kept) |
| Supplier / PO / returns | **Slice 2 DONE:** OWNER-only Supplier/PO/GRN/return APIs + Owner web Purchasing/Suppliers/Expiry Returns/Manifest Details. Dual receive: Inventory ad-hoc `POST /batches` + Purchasing GRN. |
| Print / FEFO PIN | Stubs — stay stubs |

### Milestone 6 (master plan §7) vs this file

Full M6: bi-di sync, loyalty persist, refill/n8n, supplier return, Owner web, RLS.

**This file = Slice 1 (DONE) + Slice 2 (P–AD DONE) + Slice 3 (AE–AM DONE) + Slice 4 (AN–AV Staff DONE) + Slice 5 (AW–BD DONE).** Full M6 still needs later production waves / out-of-scope items.

---

## Incremental slice protocol (mandatory)

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Active scope | Production track Waves 3+ ([`PRODUCTION_REMAINING_EXECUTION.md`](PRODUCTION_REMAINING_EXECUTION.md)). Slice 1 A–O **DONE**. Slice 2 **P–AD DONE**. Slice 3 **AE–AM DONE**. Slice 4 Staff **AN–AV DONE**. Slice 5 **AW–BD DONE** |
| More Owner screens later | Slices 6–8 → **[`M6_SLICE_6_EXECUTION.md`](M6_SLICE_6_EXECUTION.md)** (BE–BQ **DONE**). Parked wire-ups = Prod Wave 3. |
| Slice 1 complete | Batch O exit — **DONE** 2026-08-18 |
| Slice 2 complete | Batch AD exit — **DONE** 2026-09-18 |
| Slice 3 complete | Batch AM exit — **DONE** 2026-08-21 |
| Slice 4 complete | Batch AV exit — **DONE** 2026-08-21 |
| Slice 5 complete | Batch BD exit + user walkthrough PASS |
| M6 milestone complete | **Not** Slice 5 — later slices still required |
| Invent authorization | Owner Login (Slice 1). Record Supplier Decision + Complete Return **modals** (Slice 2 — **DONE** with AC). Slice 3: **Reject Registration** + **POS Create Customer**. Slice 4 Staff: screens shared. Slice 5: **desktop open/close float+count** — **DONE** (Batch AY); shift/report UI uses **prior upload** |
| Slice 5 re-share | UI batches AZ–BC may say **use prior upload** (screens shared 2026-08-22) |
| Not inventable yet | Manager web, Edit Customer, Edit Supplier page, View All Receipts, Review Reorder Suggestions page, Inventory/Purchase report detail pages, n8n, RLS, bi-di, branch switch — see production Waves 3–5 / [`M6_SLICE_6_EXECUTION.md`](M6_SLICE_6_EXECUTION.md) |

## Invented IA Map (Slice 1)

```text
Login (OWNER)
  → Dashboard
       → Sales (View all)
            → Transaction Details
       → Inventory
            → Product Details → Receive Stock
            → Add Product
            → Receive Stock (from list CTA)
            → Expiry Management (alerts / Review Inventory Alerts)

Sidebar (visible):
  LIVE (Slice 1):      Dashboard, Sales, Inventory
  LIVE (Slice 2):      Purchasing, Suppliers
  LIVE (Slice 3):      Customers  (from Batch AG)
  LIVE (Slice 4):      Staff      (from Batch AP)
  LIVE (Slice 5):      Reports    (from Batch BC; Shift Management from Staff page)
  DISABLED: Audit & FEFO, Settings,
            Help, Owner Profile
```

### Slice 1 routes (`apps/web`)

| Screen | Route |
|--------|--------|
| Login | `/login` |
| Dashboard | `/` |
| Sales | `/sales` |
| Transaction Details | `/sales/:id` |
| Inventory | `/inventory` |
| Expiry Management | `/inventory/expiry` |
| Add Product | `/inventory/new` |
| Product Details | `/inventory/:productId` |
| Receive Stock | `/inventory/:productId/receive` |
| Edit Product | `/inventory/:productId/edit` |
| Manage Batch | `/inventory/:productId/batches/:batchId` |

Register `/inventory/expiry` and `/inventory/new` **before** `/:productId`.

### Slice 2 routes (`apps/web`) — planned

| Screen | Route |
|--------|--------|
| Purchasing | `/purchasing` |
| Create Purchase Order | `/purchasing/new` (draft resume: `/purchasing/:poId/edit` — **same form**) |
| Purchase Order Details | `/purchasing/:poId` |
| Receive against PO | `/purchasing/:poId/receive` |
| Suppliers | `/suppliers` |
| Add Supplier | `/suppliers/new` |
| Supplier Details | `/suppliers/:supplierId` |
| Expiry Returns | `/suppliers/returns` |
| Create Return Manifest | `/suppliers/returns/new` |
| Return Manifest Details | `/suppliers/returns/:manifestId` |

Register `/purchasing/new`, `/suppliers/new`, `/suppliers/returns`, `/suppliers/returns/new` **before** `/:id` params.

`/suppliers/returns/:manifestId` is live Manifest Details (Batch AC).

### Slice 3 routes (`apps/web`) — planned

| Screen | Route |
|--------|--------|
| Customers | `/customers` |
| Add Customer | `/customers/new` |
| Customer Details | `/customers/:customerId` (Active / Inactive only) |
| Customer Registration Review | `/customers/:customerId/review` (Pending only) |

Register `/customers/new` **before** `/:customerId`. Pending directory rows navigate to **Review**, not Details. After approve, navigate to Details. Pending ids on Details redirect to Review. Active ids on Review redirect to Details.

---

## Design locks (Slice 1)

### Chrome consistency lock

**Canonical chrome:** screen **Dashboard**.

| Layer | Locked look |
|-------|-------------|
| **Brand** | **PharmaSync Admin Portal** (not POS, not other names) |
| **Sidebar** | Light grey; teal active item (`#0D9488`). Ignore later dark-sidebar mocks |
| **Header** | Page/breadcrumb · **store name** (not a working branch switch) · bell · search · avatar |
| **Canvas** | `#F8FAFC` · white cards · teal primary CTAs |
| **Currency** | **৳** — never `$` |

**Rule for every UI batch** (same idea as M3 Search Results - Napa):

1. Build **sidebar / header once** to this baseline (Batch B); do not restyle them per screen.
2. When matching a named screen, copy **only the content region** (main workspace / table / form / right rail).
3. If a later screenshot shows a dark sidebar, different brand string, purple accents, or a working branch switch → **ignore**; keep this lock.
4. Login (invented) should feel like the same family (teal + light grey + PharmaSync Admin Portal), not a separate theme.

**Re-share label for chrome:** `Dashboard` (chrome baseline).

### Owner web vs desktop

| Topic | Lock |
|-------|------|
| Who logs in | **OWNER only**. Manager/Cashier: same login API, client + optional server reject for web session |
| Store control | Show JWT / `GET /tenant/context` store **name**. Dropdown **disabled**. Multi-branch = **M7** |
| Receive stock | Web Add Lot uses `POST /api/v1/batches`. Desktop Add Lot stays; manual stock correction uses signed `/batches/:id/adjustments` and is never queued offline. |
| Cost / margin / net profit | Owner web **shows**. `GET /sales` redacts those fields for Manager/Cashier (POS may use list later) |
| Create Customer | **Slice 3.** Owner web Add = Active immediately. POS Cashier/Manager = Pending until Owner approves. `POST /customers` role rules land in Batch AF |
| Net Sales copy | Gross − discounts. **No returns.** Do not invent a returns ledger |
| Amount due | Always **৳0** (fully settled) |

### Parked controls (on Slice 1 screens — do not fake data)

| Mock control | Slice 1 |
|--------------|---------|
| Branch / store switch | Display only, disabled |
| Supplier on Receive | Live optional batch-level text; Batch P adds Supplier data but this ad-hoc Slice 1 flow has no Supplier selector |
| Link PO / supplier invoice on Receive | **Omit** |
| Prepare Supplier Return | **Slice 1:** disabled. **Slice 2 Batch AA:** enable → `/suppliers/returns` |
| Return eligibility | Live persisted Batch metadata; no reservation/workflow |
| Manifest workflow | Not built; `MANIFEST_PREPARED` is metadata only |
| Export | Live client-side CSV of selected or filtered expiry rows |
| Header search / bell | Chrome only; no search results / notification inbox |
| Edit Product | Live through W2 |
| More Actions, View Inventory History | Disabled |
| Card last-4 / receipt-print timeline | Show only if already on the sale (notes/reference). Do not invent |

### Colors

| Token | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Primary teal | `#0D9488` |
| Canvas | `#F8FAFC` |
| Expiry | red ≤30d / yellow ≤90d / green >90d (same as POS) |

---

## Locked product & engineering decisions

### 1. Stack

- `apps/web`: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + Lucide. Shadcn primitives as needed (may live in `apps/web` first; `@r2a/ui` is still a stub).
- Port **5173** (CORS already lists it in `.env.example`).
- Reuse M2 auth: `POST /auth/login`, refresh, `GET /users/me`.
- Envelope: `{ status, message, data?, meta? }`.

### 2. Schema (Batch C — additive)

**`Sale`:** `receiptNo` (unique per tenant), `loyaltyPrevious` Int default 0, `loyaltyUsed` Int default 0, `loyaltyEarned` Int default 0.

**`receiptNo` format:** `TXN-YYMMDD-HHmm` from `soldAt` (UTC is OK) + last 2 chars of `eventId` if needed for uniqueness. Example: `TXN-260814-1045`. Store on insert; never client-supplied.

**`SaleItem`:** `fefoOverride` Boolean default false, `fefoAuthorizedByName` String?, `costPerBaseAtSale` Decimal(12,4) — **server-filled** from the batch at ingest. Never trust client cost.

**`Product`:** optional `category`, `requiresPrescription` Boolean default false, `coldChain` Boolean default false, `storageNotes`, `reorderLevel` Int?.

**`Batch` (Batch N repair):** optional `supplierName`; `returnStatus` = `ELIGIBLE` | `NOT_ELIGIBLE` | `MANIFEST_PREPARED`, default `NOT_ELIGIBLE`. Batch P later adds optional `supplierId` plus Supplier/return-manifest models; behavior remains gated to Q/R+.

**`InventoryEvent`** (append-only):

| Field | Notes |
|-------|--------|
| `type` | `RECEIVE` \| `ADJUST` \| `SALE` |
| `quantityBaseChange` | Signed PIECE delta |
| `productId`, `batchId?`, `storeId`, `tenantId` | Required scoping |
| `saleId?` | Set on SALE |
| `actorUserId?` | JWT `sub` for RECEIVE/ADJUST |
| `eventId?`, `reasonCode?`, `quantityAfter?`, `note?` | W1/W3 audit and idempotency metadata |

Current writers: `POST /batches` (RECEIVE), signed `/batches/:id/adjustments` and lifecycle compensation (ADJUST), sale ingest (SALE per line). The original Batch D absolute PATCH writer was removed in W6.

### 3. Ingest extensions (Batch D)

Optional on `saleIngestSchema` (old POS payloads still work):

- Sale: `loyaltyUsed`, `loyaltyEarned` (ints ≥ 0)
- Item: `fefoOverride`, `fefoAuthorizedByName`

Server: if `customerId` present, snapshot `loyaltyPrevious` from `Customer.loyaltyPoints`, apply used/earned, persist customer balance. If loyalty fields omitted → snapshots 0, **do not** change points (backward compatible until desktop is wired in the same batch).

`/sales/ingest` and `/sync/ingest` share `ingestSale`. Offline queue: extra fields optional JSON — old queued events still ingest.

### 4. New routes

| Route | Roles | Batch |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `GET /api/v1/sales` | Any authenticated. **Redact** cost/margin/COGS/net-profit unless `OWNER` | E |
| `GET /api/v1/sales/:id` | Same redaction | E |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/dashboard` | `OWNER` only | F |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/inventory-summary` | `OWNER` only | F |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/expiry` | `OWNER` only | F |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/inventory` | `OWNER` only | J |
| `GET /api/v1/owner/products/:id` | `OWNER` only | K |

`GET /sales` query: `q`, `paymentMethod`, `userId`, `from`, `to`, `limit` (max 100, default 25), `offset`. `meta.total` required.

**Low stock:** `reorderLevel != null` AND `0 < onHand <= reorderLevel`.  
**Out of stock:** active product, onHand = 0.  
**Expiry buckets:** qty > 0; 0–30 / 31–60 / 61–90 days; Expired = expiry < today.

**Net profit (Owner):** `sum(lineTotal) − sum(costPerBaseAtSale * quantityBase)` for the period (discount already in `Sale.total` vs lines — prefer **sale.total − period COGS** so discounts count). Document the formula in catalog.

### 5. Out of Slice 1

Manager web, n8n, RLS, bi-di sync, Supplier/PO models, return manifests, CSV import, terminal presence, Create Customer UI, branch switching, printer IPC, `pinHash`, sale void, `creditBalance`.

## Batch overview (Slice 1)

| Batch | Title | Primary area | Depends on | Re-share screen? |
|-------|-------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **A** | Web scaffold + OWNER session | `apps/web` | M5 | Invent Login |
| **B** | Owner chrome lock | shell | A | Dashboard (chrome only) |
| **C** | Prisma + shared-types | database + types | A | No |
| **D** | Ingest + POS wire-up | server + desktop `saleIngest.ts` | C | No |
| **E** | `GET /sales` + `GET /sales/:id` | server | D | No |
| **F** | Owner dashboard / summary / expiry APIs | server | C | No |
| **G** | Dashboard screen | web | B + E + F | **Dashboard** |
| **H** | Sales list | web | G | **Sales Overview & Transactions** |
| **I** | Transaction Details | web | H | **Transaction Details** |
| **J** | Inventory list | web | B + F | **Inventory** |
| **K** | Product Details | web | J | **Product Details** |
| **L** | Add Product | web | J | **Add Product** |
| **M** | Receive Stock (web) | web | K | **Receive Stock** |
| **N** | Expiry Management | web | J + F | **Expiry Management** |
| **O** | Slice 1 exit | catalog + smoke + status | A–N | No |

Recommended chat order: **A → B → C → D → E → F → G → H → I → J → K → L → M → N → O**.

C may run after A even if B is in parallel **only if** the user authorizes it; default is strict A→O.

---

## Batch A — Web scaffold + OWNER session

**Goal:** Runnable `@r2a/web`. Owner can log in against M2. Manager/Cashier are rejected on the web app. **No chrome IA, no dashboard widgets.**

**Re-share screen:** none (invent Login to match teal / Admin Portal).

### Tasks

- [x] Replace stub [`apps/web/package.json`](apps/web/package.json) with Vite + React 19 + TS + Tailwind v4 (mirror desktop deps: `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `lucide-react`, `@r2a/shared-types`)
- [x] `vite.config.ts` port **5173**; alias `@` → `src`
- [x] `apps/web/.env.example` with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787`
- [x] i18n: `en.ts` + `bn-BD.ts` + provider; default **bn-BD**; locale switch must not require re-login
- [x] Login form: email + password → `POST /api/v1/auth/login` + store access/refresh like desktop session
- [x] After login: `GET /users/me`. If `role !== "OWNER"` → clear session, show i18n error, stay on login
- [x] Logged-in placeholder route `/` (“Owner portal” + Logout). No sidebar yet
- [x] `npm run smoke:m6a -w @r2a/web`: package name, vite port 5173, OWNER gate in source
- [x] Do **not** build sidebar. Do **not** add Prisma fields. Do **not** add `GET /sales`

### Allowed focus

- `apps/web/**` (scaffold)
- Root workspace already includes `apps/*`
- `apps/web/scripts/smoke-m6a.ts` + package.json script
- This file’s Batch A checkboxes

### Exit check

- `npm run dev -w @r2a/web` serves login
- Owner login lands on placeholder home
- Manager/Cashier login shows reject copy
- `smoke:m6a` PASS

### Ask-before-inventing

Low-ask. Do not invent dashboard cards.

### Agent prompt

```text
Implement ONLY Batch A from MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md
(Web scaffold + OWNER session).
Vite+React+TS+Tailwind on @r2a/web port 5173. i18n en + bn-BD.
Owner login via M2 auth; reject MANAGER and CASHIER.
No sidebar, no GET /sales, no schema.
When done, paste the short M6 Batch A report.
```

### User walkthrough (after Batch A)

**YOU DO**

1. API running. `npm run dev -w @r2a/web` → http://localhost:5173/
2. Login `cashier@demo.local` — must **fail** (stay on login).
3. Login `owner@demo.local` / `ChangeMe123!` — placeholder home + Logout.

**Next:** After PASS, new chat → `Authorize M6 Batch B`.

---

## Batch B — Owner chrome lock

**Goal:** Sidebar + header locked. Live nav: Dashboard, Sales, Inventory (placeholder pages OK). Later nav **visible and disabled**. Store name shown, **not** switchable.

**Re-share screen:** **Dashboard** (chrome only — ignore main widgets until G).

### Tasks

- [x] Ask for **Dashboard** screenshot first; stop until shared / “use prior upload”
- [x] Sidebar IA per this file; active state teal
- [x] Header: breadcrumb/title slot · store name from tenant/me · bell + search **non-functional** · avatar
- [x] Footer area of sidebar: Help + Owner Profile **disabled**
- [x] Routes exist for `/`, `/sales`, `/inventory` as empty shells (i18n titles)
- [x] Locale control somewhere accessible (header or later Settings — for Slice 1: header or login-already-has is OK; do not build Settings page)
- [x] i18n all chrome strings
- [x] `smoke:m6b`: sidebar labels include disabled later items; Purchasing remained disabled until Batch S
- [x] Do **not** fetch dashboard KPIs (Batch G)

### Exit check

- Owner sees Admin Portal chrome
- Disabled items do not route
- Store control does not change `storeId`

### Agent prompt

```text
Implement ONLY Batch B from MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md
(Owner chrome lock).
Re-share: Dashboard — stop until the user shares or says use prior.
Then build sidebar + header only. Later nav disabled.
No KPI data. No GET /sales UI tables.
When done, paste the short M6 Batch B report.
```

### User walkthrough

**YOU DO:** Open web as Owner. Confirm sidebar list + disabled later items + store name visible.

**Next:** `Authorize M6 Batch C`.

---

## Batch C — Prisma + shared-types

**Goal:** Additive schema + Zod. Migrate. **No** ingest behavior change yet (old ingest still works). **No** web screens.

**Re-share screen:** none.

### Tasks

- [x] Prisma fields/models per **Locked decisions §2** (`Sale`, `SaleItem`, `Product`, `InventoryEvent` enum+model). Tenant relations + indexes (`tenantId`, `saleId`, `productId`)
- [x] `receiptNo` unique with `tenantId` (`@@unique([tenantId, receiptNo])`)
- [x] Zod: extend product create/update; sale ingest optionals; new owner/sales query DTOs **stubs OK if unused until E/F** — prefer adding ingest + product schemas now
- [x] `prisma migrate` + generate. Existing seed still runs
- [x] Optional: seed `reorderLevel` on Napa only if needed for later low-stock demo — do **not** rewrite catalog
- [x] Do **not** change `ingestSale` logic yet (Batch D)
- [x] Do **not** add GET routes yet

### Allowed focus

- `packages/database/prisma/**`
- `packages/shared-types/**`
- This file’s Batch C checkboxes

### Exit check

- Migrate applies on Neon/local
- `npm run smoke:m2 -w @r2a/server` still PASS (ingest unchanged)

### Agent prompt

```text
Implement ONLY Batch C from MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md
(Prisma + shared-types).
Additive Sale/SaleItem/Product/InventoryEvent fields. Zod for new columns.
Do not change ingestSale behavior. Do not add GET /sales.
When done, paste the short M6 Batch C report.
```

### User walkthrough

**YOU DO:** Confirm migrate applied (agent should run it). Optional: `smoke:m2`.

**Next:** `Authorize M6 Batch D`.

---

## Batch D — Ingest extensions + POS wire-up

**Goal (historical Batch D):** New sales persist loyalty snapshots, FEFO flags, cost-at-sale, receiptNo, SALE inventory events. Batch D originally wrote ADJUST on absolute PATCH; W6 superseded that writer with signed adjustments. Desktop `saleIngest.ts` sends the new fields. **Cashier UX unchanged.**

**Re-share screen:** none.

### Tasks

- [x] `ingestSale`: generate `receiptNo`; fill `costPerBaseAtSale`; persist FEFO flags; loyalty snapshot + `Customer.loyaltyPoints` update when fields present; write `InventoryEvent` SALE rows
- [x] Idempotent replay: do **not** double-apply loyalty or events
- [x] `POST /batches` → RECEIVE event (`quantityBaseChange` = qty posted)
- [x] Historical Batch D PATCH qty → ADJUST event (superseded and removed by W6 signed `/adjustments`)
- [x] Desktop [`saleIngest.ts`](apps/desktop/src/lib/saleIngest.ts): send `loyaltyUsed` / `loyaltyEarned` from existing `loyaltyCalc`; send per-line `fefoOverride` + `fefoAuthorizedByName`. Keep notes for card/MFS as today
- [x] Do **not** change Redeem OTP stub / PIN stub
- [x] `smoke:m6d` (server and/or desktop source): ingest with override line + loyalty fields persists; old payload without them still 200
- [x] `smoke:m2` still PASS

### Exit check

- New POS completed sale (online) has `receiptNo` + cost snapshot in Postgres
- Old smoke ingest still works
- Desktop checkout looks the same

### Agent prompt

```text
Implement ONLY Batch D from MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md
(Ingest extensions + POS saleIngest wire-up).
Loyalty + FEFO + costPerBaseAtSale + receiptNo + InventoryEvent.
Cashier UX unchanged. Keep /sync/ingest on ingestSale.
When done, paste the short M6 Batch D report.
```

### User walkthrough

**YOU DO:** Optional: POS Owner or Cashier complete one Napa sale (open shift). Agent may verify via API.

**Next:** `Authorize M6 Batch E`.

---

## Batch E — GET sales list + detail

**Goal:** Cloud sales read API. Owner sees cost/COGS fields. Manager/Cashier get the same sale **without** cost/margin. **No** Owner web tables yet.

**Re-share screen:** none.

### Tasks

- [x] `GET /api/v1/sales` + `GET /api/v1/sales/:id` (id = Prisma `Sale.id`; also accept `receiptNo` **or** document id-only — **lock: `:id` is Sale.id**; list returns `id` + `receiptNo`)
- [x] Include customer name/phone, cashier name, items+product names, payments, loyalty snapshots, `fefoOverride` on lines
- [x] Redact `costPerBaseAtSale`, line/sale COGS, margins unless `OWNER`
- [x] Pagination `meta.total`
- [x] `restrictTo` not required (any authenticated) — redaction is the control
- [x] `smoke:m6e`: owner list 200 with cost; cashier list 200 without cost keys; 401 without token
- [x] Do **not** build `/sales` UI (Batch H)

### Exit check

- `smoke:m6e` PASS
- Envelope matches existing style

### Agent prompt

```text
Implement ONLY Batch E from MILESTONE_6_EXECUTION.md
(GET /sales and GET /sales/:id).
Owner sees cost fields; cashier/manager redacted.
No Owner web sales table.
When done, paste the short M6 Batch E report.
```

### User walkthrough

**YOU DO:** none required if smoke PASS (or curl with owner token if you want).

**Next:** `Authorize M6 Batch F`.

---

## Batch F — Owner dashboard / inventory-summary / expiry APIs

**Goal:** Three OWNER-only aggregate endpoints. Manager **403**. **No** web widgets yet.

**Re-share screen:** none.

**Re-share screen:** **Inventory**.

### Tasks

- [x] Ask for screenshot; stop until reply
- [x] `GET /owner/inventory-summary` + paged `GET /products` + batches as needed (or one Owner list endpoint **if** product GET is too chatty — **prefer** a `GET /api/v1/owner/inventory` list in this batch rather than N+1 from the browser). If added, OWNER-only, document in catalog at O

| Inventory → Receive | Ad-hoc / opening stock / no PO | Keep Slice 1 `POST /batches` |
| Purchasing → Receive against PO | Goods vs a PO | New GRN record + `POST /batches` (or internal shared create-lot) with `supplierId` + `purchaseOrderId`; update PO remaining qty |

Desktop Settings Receive stays ad-hoc. Same lot table. No offline GRN.

### Parked on Slice 2 mocks (do not invent extra screens)

| Control | Slice 2 |
|---------|---------|
| Review Reorder Suggestions | **Disabled** |
| View All Receipts / GRN list | **Disabled** |
| Edit Supplier | **No page.** Add Supplier only |
| Extra draft-resume screen | **None.** Save as Draft uses Create PO form; reopen `/purchasing/:poId/edit` |
| Export / Print / More Actions | **Disabled** unless a later slice shares them |
| Header search / bell / branch switch | Unchanged Slice 1 chrome |
| Save as Draft on Add Supplier / GRN | Add Supplier → **Disabled** (no Edit page; Batch Y). GRN → **Disabled** (Batch W). Persist only if the same page can reopen it |

**Keep live on shared Create PO:** **Add Suggested Items** (inline, not a new page).

### Domain numbers

| Kind | Format |
|------|--------|
| PO | `PO-YYMMDD-####` unique per tenant |
| GRN | `GRN-YYMM-####` unique per tenant |
| Return manifest | `SRM-YYMMDD-####` unique per tenant |

### Schema (Batch P — additive)

New models (all `tenantId`-scoped): `Supplier`, `PurchaseOrder`, `PurchaseOrderLine`, `GoodsReceipt`, `GoodsReceiptLine`, `ReturnManifest`, `ReturnManifestLine`.

**`Supplier`:** name, contactPerson, phone, email?, address?, city?, registrationNumber?, notes?, paymentTerms?, leadTimeDays?, minOrderValue?, status `ACTIVE` \| `HOLD` \| `DRAFT`, expiryReturnsAccepted, minDaysBeforeExpiry?, returnNotes?, preferredContact?, secondaryPhone?, `isActive`.

**`PurchaseOrder`:** `poNumber`, `supplierId`, store from JWT, status `DRAFT` \| `SENT` \| `PARTIALLY_RECEIVED` \| `RECEIVED`, `reference?`, `expectedDelivery?`, createdBy, money totals (estimated). Creating a PO **does not** change inventory.

**`PurchaseOrderLine`:** `productId`, `qtyOrdered` PIECE, `qtyReceived` default 0, `costPerBase` snapshot.

**`GoodsReceipt`:** `grnNumber`, `purchaseOrderId`, `supplierInvoiceRef?`, `deliveryNote?`, `receivedAt`, `receivedByUserId`, status `CONFIRMED` (no draft GRN list). Confirm creates lots.

**`GoodsReceiptLine`:** `productId`, `qty` PIECE, `batchNumber`, `expiryDate`, `costPerBase`, `sellPerBase` → creates `Batch` + `InventoryEvent` RECEIVE; set `Batch.supplierId` (new optional FK) and keep `supplierName` denormalized from Supplier.name.

**`ReturnManifest`:** `srmNumber`, `supplierId`, status `PREPARED` \| `DISPATCHED` \| `ACCEPTED` \| `REJECTED` \| `COMPLETED`, preparedBy, preparedAt, supplierReference?, notes?, dispatch fields, decision fields, completedAt?.

**`ReturnManifestLine`:** `batchId`, `returnQty` PIECE, cost snapshot at prepare.

**`Batch.returnStatus`:** keep enum; creating a manifest sets lines to `MANIFEST_PREPARED`. Dispatch does **not** revert that; Eligible queue hides/disables those rows.

Optional `Batch.supplierId` FK — do not drop `supplierName` in Slice 2.

### Return lifecycle spec (one Manifest Details page)

Status stepper: **Prepared → Dispatched → Supplier Decision (Accepted) → Completed**.

| Current | Primary CTA | Effect |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| PREPARED | Record Dispatch | Shared modal. After confirm: signed `POST /batches/:id/adjustments` per line (`reasonCode` `SUPPLIER_RETURN_DISPATCH`, negative qty, `expectedVersion`, `eventId`). Stock leaves. Status **DISPATCHED**. |
| DISPATCHED | Record Supplier Decision | Invented modal (spec below). **Accepted** → **ACCEPTED**. **Rejected** → **REJECTED** (terminal). Stock already gone — **do not** auto-restore. |
| ACCEPTED | Complete Return | Invented modal. No further stock move. Status **COMPLETED**. |
| REJECTED / COMPLETED | none | Read-only. Dispatch/decision disabled |

**Inventory effect panel:** PREPARED = “Not yet posted” + projected deduction. After dispatch = posted / deducted.

#### Record Supplier Decision (invent — match Dispatch modal family)

- Title: Record Supplier Decision. Subtext: Record the supplier’s decision on this prepared dispatch.
- Manifest + supplier (read-only).
- Decision * : Accepted \| Rejected.
- Credit note / reference: optional; required-looking only when Accepted (optional in API).
- Notes.
- Confirm checkbox: “I confirm this is the supplier’s decision.”
- Cancel / Confirm Decision.

#### Complete Return (invent)

- Title: Complete Return. Subtext: Close this return. Inventory was already adjusted at dispatch.
- Manifest + supplier + units + cost (read-only).
- Checkbox: “I confirm this return is complete.”
- Cancel / Complete Return.

Do **not** create separate page components per status. Same details route; fields/CTAs/progress/activity/inventory effect switch on status.

### Create Return Manifest (dedicated page)

Not the queue. Queue selection (same supplier only) → `/suppliers/returns/new`. Page reviews batches, qtys, cost, supplier policy, Confirm → create SRM → details. Mixed-supplier selection blocked. Manifest Prepared rows not selectable.

**Re-share gate:** no screenshot in chat. Agent **stops** and asks before Batch AB.

---

## Slice 3 — Customers + POS registration approval

User shared Owner web Customers screens 2026-08-19 and locked: **skip remaining Slice 2 (AC–AD deferred)**; start Slice 3; cashier POS create is allowed but **Owner must approve** before the profile is Active. Owner-created customers skip approval. Email optional. `apps/web` stays OWNER-only.

Edit Customer, Reject screenshot, and POS Create screenshot were **not** shared. Locked invent/park:

| Missing control | Slice 3 |
|-----------------|---------|
| Edit Customer / More Actions | **Park / disable** |
| Reject Registration modal | **Invent** (match Approve modal family; spec below) |
| POS Create Customer | **Invent** (name + phone; Select Customer family; spec below) |

Staff / Reports / Audit & FEFO / Settings / Help / Owner Profile were **not** shared — stay disabled until Slice 4+.

### Slice 3 IA

```text
Customers
  → Add Customer
       → Create confirm modal → Customer Details (Active, Owner Created)
  → Customer Details            (Active / Inactive)
  → Pending row → Registration Review
       → Approve Customer modal → Customer Details (Active)
       → Reject Registration modal (invented) → directory (hidden)

POS Select Customer (F8)
  → Create Customer (invented; name + phone)
       Cashier / Manager → PENDING_APPROVAL (do not attach to sale)
       Owner             → ACTIVE immediately (may attach)
```

**4 unique pages + 3 modals** (Approve shared, Create confirm shared, Reject invented) **+ 1 POS modal**.

### Dual create (locked)

| Path | Who | Result |
|------|-----|--------|
| Owner web Add Customer | OWNER | `ACTIVE` + `OWNER_CREATED`. Optional email / DOB / gender / address. No approval. |
| POS Create | CASHIER or MANAGER | `PENDING_APPROVAL` + `POS_REGISTRATION`. Name + phone only. Not selectable until approved. |
| POS Create | OWNER | `ACTIVE` + `POS_REGISTRATION` (created at the counter). May attach to the current sale. |

Phone is **required**. POS `GET /customers` and sale ingest attach **Active** only. Pending / rejected never appear at F8.

### Parked on Slice 3 mocks

| Control | Slice 3 |
|---------|---------|
| Edit Customer | **Disabled** |
| More Actions | **Disabled** |
| Inactive mutation | **No UI.** Tab filters existing `INACTIVE` rows only |
| Header search / bell / branch switch | Unchanged chrome lock |
| Loyalty point adjust | **None.** Activity = sale snapshots only |
| `creditBalance` / Baki | **Forbidden** |

### Customer status / source

| Enum | Values |
|------|--------|
| `CustomerStatus` | `ACTIVE` \| `PENDING_APPROVAL` \| `INACTIVE` \| `REJECTED` |
| `CustomerSource` | `OWNER_CREATED` \| `POS_REGISTRATION` |
| `CustomerGender` | `MALE` \| `FEMALE` \| `OTHER` (optional) |

Rejected rows stay in the DB for audit, are **hidden** from the directory, and **release** the phone unique so the same number can register again (partial unique index `WHERE status <> REJECTED`).

### Schema (Batch AE — additive)

Extend `Customer` (all `tenantId`-scoped): required `phone`; `status` default `ACTIVE`; `source`; optional `storeId`, `createdByUserId`, `dateOfBirth`, `gender`, `address`; approval/reject audit fields (`approvedAt`, `approvedByUserId`, `rejectedAt`, `rejectedByUserId`, `rejectionNote`).

Keep `loyaltyPoints` and unused `creditBalance`. Do **not** drop `@@unique([tenantId, phone])` without replacing it with the partial unique for non-rejected rows.

**Seed:** Karim + Nusrat → `ACTIVE` + `OWNER_CREATED`. Add one **pending POS** demo (name + phone, cashier `createdByUserId`) so Review is walkthrough-ready.

### Return lifecycle analog — approval spec

| Current | Primary CTA | Effect |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| PENDING_APPROVAL | Approve Customer | Shared modal. Optional profile patch (name/phone/email/DOB/gender/address). Status **ACTIVE**. Then available at POS. |
| PENDING_APPROVAL | Reject Registration | Invented modal. Status **REJECTED**. Hidden from directory. **No** POS attach. Phone reusable. |
| ACTIVE / INACTIVE | none (this slice) | Details read-only. Edit parked. |
| REJECTED | none | Not listed |

### Reject Registration (invent — match Approve modal family)

- Title: Reject Registration. Subtext: This POS registration will not become an active customer.
- Manifest analog: customer name + phone + source + branch (read-only).
- Optional note.
- Confirm checkbox: “I confirm that I have reviewed this registration and want to reject it.”
- Cancel / Reject Registration (destructive). Checkbox gates the primary.

### POS Create Customer (invent — match Select Customer family)

- Open from Select Customer (F8). Fields: name *, phone * only.
- Online only. Offline → i18n toast; Walk-in still available.
- Live phone-check; 409 duplicate.
- Keyboard: arrows / Enter / Esc. **No Tab.**
- Cashier/Manager success: **do not attach**; toast that Owner must approve; stay on Select Customer.
- Owner success: Active; **may attach** to the current sale.
- No offline customer queue (M4 stays sales-only).

## Slice 4 — Staff (Owner Web)

User shared Owner web Staff screens 2026-08-21 and locked: **Staff only** for Slice 4; Reports / Audit & FEFO / Settings / Help / Owner Profile stay disabled until shared. Slice 2 **AC–AD remain deferred**. Plan: [`.cursor/plans/m6_slice_4_staff_e508519b.plan.md`](.cursor/plans/m6_slice_4_staff_e508519b.plan.md).

### Locked product decisions

| Topic | Lock |
|-------|------|
| Scope | **Staff only.** Reports / Audit & FEFO / Settings / Help / Owner Profile stay `live: false` |
| Slice 2 AC–AD | Still **deferred** |
| Login | **Email + password** unchanged. Mock “Username” = **email local-part** (display only; read-only on Edit) |
| Create credentials | Server **generates** temp password (min 8); return **once** in create response; Owner copies it. **No** password field on Add Staff form |
| Roles | `MANAGER` \| `CASHIER` only. Mock “Inventory Staff” is **not** a role — omit from dropdown |
| Branch | **Single store** (Phase 1). Assigned Branch = tenant store (required; one option). No multi-branch switch |
| More Actions | **Deactivate** (Active) / **Reactivate** (Inactive) only |
| Chrome | Keep Dashboard chrome lock; ignore dark/purple mock sidebars |
| Web RBAC | `apps/web` **OWNER-only**. Staff owner APIs = `restrictTo("OWNER")`. Existing `POST /users` (OWNER\|MANAGER) may remain for desktop/API |
| Self-lockout | Owner **cannot** deactivate self; **Edit** disabled for own row (Details read-only). Cannot create/edit anyone to `OWNER` / `SUPER_ADMIN` |
| Payments / Baki | Unchanged. No sale void |

### Slice 4 IA

```text
Staff (list)
  → Add Staff
       → one-time temp password reveal → Staff Details (Active)
  → View → Staff Details (Active | Inactive)
       → Edit Staff → Staff Details
       → More Actions → Deactivate Staff modal → Details (Inactive)
       → More Actions → Reactivate Staff modal → Details (Active)
```

**4 unique pages + 2 modals** (Deactivate + Reactivate shared).

### Routes (`apps/web`)

| Screen | Route |
|--------|--------|
| Staff list | `/staff` |
| Add Staff | `/staff/new` |
| Staff Details | `/staff/:userId` |
| Edit Staff | `/staff/:userId/edit` |

### Parked on Slice 4 mocks

| Control | Slice 4 |
|---------|---------|
| Inventory Staff role | **Omit** — not in `Role` enum |
| Multi-branch / branch switcher | **Disabled** (chrome lock; single store) |
| Header search / bell | Unchanged chrome lock |
| Password reset email / invite email | **None** — temp password in UI only |
| Reports / Audit / Settings / Help / Owner Profile | **Disabled** until Slice 5+ |
| Edit Customer / Edit Supplier / Manifest Details (AC) | Still parked / deferred |

### Schema (Batch AN — additive)

Extend `User` (tenant-scoped):
- `phone` `String?` (required in Owner Add/Edit UI)
- `internalNote` `String?`
- `lastLoginAt` `DateTime?` — set on successful login in Batch AO
- Keep `isActive` for Active/Inactive
- **No** `username` column — derive display = `email.split("@")[0]`

New enum `StaffActivityType`: `CREATED` \| `ROLE_CHANGED` \| `BRANCH_CHANGED` \| `DEACTIVATED` \| `REACTIVATED` \| `PROFILE_UPDATED`

New model `StaffActivityEvent`: `id`, `tenantId`, `userId` (subject), `actorUserId`, `type`, optional `fromValue` / `toValue` / `note`, `createdAt`; indexes on `(tenantId, userId)`.

**Seed:** keep demo owner/manager/cashier; add one **inactive** cashier for Inactive tab walkthrough. Optional backfill `CREATED` activity for seeded staff.

### API surface (Batch AO)

Owner-only under `/api/v1/owner/users*`:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/owner/users` | Paged list + search + role/status + KPIs (`total`, `active`, `inactive`, `cashiers`) |
| `GET` | `/owner/users/:id` | Detail + store name + activity + derived username |
| `POST` | `/owner/users` | Create; generate password; return `{ user, temporaryPassword }` once; `CREATED` activity |
| `PATCH` | `/owner/users/:id` | Edit profile/role/store; **block self**; activity on changes |
| `POST` | `/owner/users/:id/deactivate` | `isActive=false`; revoke refresh tokens; optional reason; **block self** |
| `POST` | `/owner/users/:id/reactivate` | `isActive=true` |

Also: login success → update `lastLoginAt`. Inactive users already fail login — keep that.

Catalog **§24** at Batch AV.

### Batch overview (Slice 4)

| Batch | Title | Depends on | Re-share? |
|-------|-------|------------|-----------|
| **AN** | Prisma + Zod + seed | Slice 3 AM | No |
| **AO** | Owner staff APIs + login `lastLoginAt` | AN | No |

| **AR** | Add Staff + temp password reveal | AQ | **Add Staff** — use prior upload |

| **AT** | Edit Staff | AS | **Edit Staff** — use prior upload |
| **AU** | Deactivate + Reactivate modals | AS | both modals — use prior upload |
| **AV** | Slice 4 exit | AN–AU | No |

Order: **AN → AO → AP → AQ → AR → AS → AT → AU → AV**.

### Parked on Slice 5 mocks

| Control | Slice 5 |
|---------|---------|
| Request Cash Count | **Disabled** + hint |
| Generate Shift Report | **Disabled** |
| Export / Print (shift list) | **Disabled** |
| Reports: Sales / Inventory / Purchase **View Report** | **Disabled** (detail pages not shared) |
| Audit & FEFO / Settings / Help / Owner Profile | **Disabled** |
| Manifest Details (AC) | Still **deferred** |

### Wired controls

| Control | Destination |
|---------|-------------|
| View POS Activity | `/sales` with `cashierId` + shift date range |
| View Shift Reports (Reports) | `/staff/shifts` |
| Shift Report card (Reports) | `/staff/shifts` |
| Review (flagged row) | Review Cash Variance modal |

### Schema (Batch AW — additive)

Enum `ShiftStatus`: `OPEN` \| `CLOSED` \| `FLAGGED`

Enum `ShiftVarianceDecision`: `ACCEPTED_DIFFERENCE` \| `COUNT_CORRECTED` \| `OTHER`

Enum `ShiftActivityType`: `OPENED` \| `SALE_RECORDED` \| `CLOSE_SUBMITTED` \| `VARIANCE_REVIEWED` \| `CLOSED`

**`Shift`:** `id`, `tenantId`, `storeId`, `userId`, `shiftNo` (unique per tenant), `status`, `openingFloat`, `openedAt`, `closedAt?`, `countedCash?`, `expectedCash?`, `variance?`, `cashSales`, `cardSales`, `mfsSales`, `txnCount`, `varianceDecision?`, `varianceNote?`, `adjustmentReference?`, `reviewedAt?`, `reviewedByUserId?`, timestamps.

**`ShiftActivityEvent`:** tenant-scoped audit timeline for Activity History card.

**`Sale`:** optional `shiftId` FK — set on ingest/sync when cashier has OPEN shift.

**Seed:** 1 OPEN, 1 CLOSED balanced, 1 FLAGGED unresolved, 1 FLAGGED resolved — with linked sales.

### API surface (Batch AX)

**Cashier / Manager (desktop):**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/shifts/open` | `openingFloat` required |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/shifts/:id/close` | `countedCash` required; FLAGGED if variance ≠ 0 |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/shifts/active` | Current user's open shift for JWT store |

**Owner (web):**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/owner/shifts` | Paged list + KPIs + filters |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/owner/shifts/:id` | Detail + payment breakdown + activity |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/owner/shifts/:id/resolve` | Owner review → CLOSED + audit |

Also: `POST /sales/ingest` + sync ingest attach `shiftId`; reject sale if no open shift. Extend `GET /owner/dashboard` `staff.openShifts` / `cashVarianceToday`. New or extended `GET /api/v1/owner/reports/dashboard` for Reports page widgets.

Catalog **§25** at Batch BD.

## Later backlog (do not build in Slice 5)

| Track | Item |
|-------|------|
| Deferred Slice 2 | Batch AC Manifest Details + 3 modals; Batch AD Slice 2 exit |
| Manager | Manager web screens + Manager authorization matrix |
| Nav | Audit & FEFO, Settings, Help, Owner Profile |
| Reports detail | Sales Report / Inventory Report / Purchase Report detail pages (View Report disabled in Slice 5) |
| Owner | Edit Customer, Edit Supplier, View All Receipts, Review Reorder Suggestions page, notifications, branch switch, Customer Inactive mutation, loyalty adjust |
| Slice 2 parked | Extra draft-resume pages; Export/Print/More Actions; auto-restore stock on rejected return |
| M6 rest | Bi-di sync, n8n, Postgres RLS, full loyalty/refill beyond ingest snapshots |
| POS / hardware | Printer IPC, card SDK, MFS APIs, FEFO `pinHash`, Slice 7+ |
| M7 | Multi-branch, transfers, Super Admin console |
